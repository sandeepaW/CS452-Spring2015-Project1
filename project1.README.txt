description: To start the game we have to click on the start button and then have to count the number of vertices and submit
the answer by clicking the specific button.. It is designed in the way that switch between the image and the canvas.
Once we hit on the START button the image will be hidden and in case if we click on a wrong button then canvas will be disappear 
and respective image file will load with the total. 
There are 11 rotating quadrilaterals and rotating speed will be increased after each move.
If we complete the game or submit any wrong answer then we have to refresh the page to play it again.
Twelve jpg images are using for the project. (I was unable to upload the images to github, 
so I sent an email to you with all image files from the email adderss sandimaya1@gmail.com)
